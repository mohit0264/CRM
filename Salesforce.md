# Salesforce:
The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a company specializing in software as a service (SaaS). Harris, Moellenhoff and Dominguez, three software developers previously at consulting firm Left Coast Software, were introduced to Benioff through friend and former Oracle colleague Bobby Yazdani. Harris and team wrote the initial sales automation software

When Marc Benioff left Oracle to found Salesforce he did so not only with Larry Ellison's blessing, not only with Larry Ellison's financial backing, not only with Larry Ellison's idea, but also with Larry's/Oracle's playbook. He'd been a VP at Oracle and learned how the Enterprise software game was played from Larry (and Tom Siebel, in whose eponymous company they'd both invested) and did a spectacular job of adjusting that playbook to web/SaaS. And then Marc and the team did an even more tremendous job of executing those plays. Another Quoran described that as an "an exceptional sales and marketing machine" which is certainly true but doesn't explain how it was built.

Salesforce CRM is a SaaS product of Force.com. It is the world leading CRM tool with the most innovative features to manage your presales, sales, after sales and marketing activities.  

Now it’s open end, force.com platform which gives you freedom to develop, customize and configure your own system for any instance not just the standard CRM functionality. You can develop your own applications like warehouse management system, recruitment and payroll management, project management, surveys etc and all this too without knowing any coding (Programming Skills). 80% customization and 20% coding makes salesforce most efficient tool for any organization.

Salesforce release proprietary language called Apex, syntactically similar to Java. Apex was object oriented and lets your complex operations like any other language do and this language hides heavy upliftment on code on backend, mostly written in java. Apex is compiled/decompiled only on Salesforce servers (so you have been connected with your IDE) or directly code on browsers.

Most of the companies are using Salesforce to improve the business productivity and effectiveness.

# Why to use salesforce?

- It's a system of record - The reason companies get CRMs in the first place is to keep track of things. This might start with contact information, products and services for quotes, but if you invest in making the system better and actually plan you can set yourself up for a future where you have answers lying in data for questions you haven't even thought of yet. This concept is not exclusive to salesforce, but it's one of the best at making it happen, because...
- It's robust. If you're going to rely on a system, and hold people accountable to putting information in there, that system better be robust - salesforce is. It's meant to be tweaked. This may appear less "user friendly" to start because there is simply more there to play with. 
- It's customizable - if you care, you can make it do pretty much everything within reason. If you can get a developer on it, you can do things out of reason too.
- You can integrate it with loads of other programs -  Since it's such a dynamo in its market, it already has tons of companies who already have salesforce integrations to make things easy, or you can integrate it with your own software if you like.

- Salesforce has its own maintenance schedule since runs on its own cloud server.  As a result, there are times that the application will not be accessible.
- Overly simple user interface that is quickly outgrown by experienced users
- Customization toolkits can be cumbersome to use, even to many seasoned administrators
- No Service Level Agreement provided in standard contract.
- Vandor dependancy
- Users can also lose a personal touch as in the process of automation
